# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

I created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day. The app allows the user to input tasks for each hour and then gives them the option to save them in local storage. When the user returns to the page their saved tasks will be reloaded.

## Tasks 

- Added today's date to the header of the application.
- Created timeblocks for each hour 9am-5pm.
- Time blocks are color-coded based on past present and future.
- Clicking timeblock allows user to input task and save the task to local storage.
